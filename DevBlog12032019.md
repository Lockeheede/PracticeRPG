Hello. So I've made a fix to the weaponRange issue. It was because I had the InteractWithMovement and the InteractWithCombat methods
in the wrong order. I'll update the new version as soon as I can. For now I'm in class (teaching, not learning...well...learning, too.) so
I can't push the new information. But I will hopefully tonight.
