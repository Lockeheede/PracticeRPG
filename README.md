# PracticeRPG
A Unity RPG Project

This is a project from the gamedev people. They made an intermediate C# coded tutorial to make a point and click RPG game. 
I am making a version of my own to practice my skills as well as being a part of a team (Ft Worth's Games By Moonlight) and working
with them. So, there are two different contributions. 
This is a legit tutorial so far, one where they take everyone into consideration and teach like teachers, instead of just throwing things
at you, expecting you to know what they are talking about (like most game dev people). Check the site I am learning from on udemy:
